First install the dev version of `usethis`:



Open the local project for the repo and pull changes, either by clicking on the PULL button in RStudio or as follows:

```{r}
git2r::pull()
```


Bring the pull request into your workspace:

```{r}
usethis::pr_fetch(8)
```

Now we need to work. Make some changes to a file, commit them, and then see what happens next.
